■コードの説明
どこまでやっていいものか？と思いましたが、とりあえず。。。

・とりあえず、PHP5.4以降で動作確認済み
・データの配列をforeachでループするのではなく、折角なのでVisitor＋array_walkで処理するパターン
・除算する数とそれに対応するメッセージは密な関係だと思うので、あえてFizzBuzzSpecificationに両者を持たせるようにした(ホントならfizzbuzz.phpを変更したい)
・出力部分をWriter化し、Writerを追加することで他の出力方法(ファイルなど)に対応させた
・コメントはPHP_DocBlockGeneratorを使って手抜き
